                  My journey through high school was filled with ups and downs,
                  especially during the challenging times brought by the
                  COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the difficulties, I stayed
                  committed to my goals and pushed myself to stay productive and
                  focused. In my SPM, I proudly achieved outstanding results —
                  9As, including an A+, 3As, and 2A-. I was also honoured with
                  the Best Subject Award for Biology. It wasn’t an easy path,
                  but my dedication and perseverance kept me going. I’m deeply
                  grateful to my teachers and friends, whose constant support
                  and encouragement helped me through the toughest moments.
                  Without them, I wouldn’t have made it this far.

                  During my matriculation studies, I took Biology, Mathematics,
                  Chemistry, and Computer Science. It was my first time learning
                  Computer Science, and I instantly fell in love with it. That
                  experience sparked my passion and led me to pursue a degree in
                  Software Engineering. Achieving a perfect 4.00 CGPA in both
                  semesters was no easy feat, especially with the packed and
                  demanding schedule. However, with discipline, resilience, and
                  a genuine interest in what I was learning, I managed to
                  overcome the challenges and stay on top of my goals.

                  As I progressed into my degree in Software Engineering, I had
                  the opportunity to explore the world of computing in much
                  greater depth. From learning core programming concepts and
                  software development methodologies to understanding system
                  design, databases, and human-computer interaction, this course
                  has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of how
                  software is built, maintained, and optimised.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Currently in Semester 4, I have maintained an excellent
                  academic performance, with a CGPA of 3.965. I’m proud of this
                  achievement, especially as I’ve been applying what I’ve
                  learned in real-life scenarios, such as academic projects and
                  personal development initiatives. The hands-on experience and
                  practical knowledge I’ve gained so far have strengthened my
                  passion for this field and continue to inspire me to grow as a
                  future software engineer.
