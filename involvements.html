                  During my matriculation year at Kolej Matrikulasi Perak
                  (KMPk), I was honoured to be selected to represent my college
                  in various academic and co-curricular activities. One of the

                  Kampar. Although I did not win, I gained invaluable exposure
                  and new knowledge in the field of chemistry, and had the
                  opportunity to interact with other passionate students from
                  across the state.

                  My active involvement did not stop there. I was also selected
                  by my Biology lecturer to represent the Jurusan Sains Komputer
                  (Computer Science stream) in a special field expedition to
                  Cameron Highlands. I was chosen to collect specimens of
                  Calymperes camerunense, a species of moss, for a major
                  laboratory experiment involving all biology students at KMPk.
                  It was an enriching experience that allowed me to explore
                  biodiversity, particularly mosses and ferns, in their natural
                  habitat.

                  During my first year, I joined my first co-curricular

                  comfort zone, as acting was never one of my strong suits.
                  However, the experience turned out to be incredibly rewarding.
                  I gained new skills in stage performance, teamwork, and
                  creative expression, while also building confidence through
                  something unfamiliar. As part of the programme, we organised a
                  theatre project where some of us had to act and perform in
                  front of an audience. A new and exciting challenge for me.

                  In my second semester, I joined another co-curricular activity
                  which is netball. Sports have never been my strongest area,
                  but throughout the semester, I gradually built physical
                  strength and confidence through training and playing. As part
                  of the programme, we were tasked with organising a netball
                  competition, and I took on the role of a sponsorship committee
                  member. I successfully secured a sponsorship from Janzen,
                  which was a proud achievement for me and a valuable learning
                  experience in communication, negotiation, and event
                  coordination.
