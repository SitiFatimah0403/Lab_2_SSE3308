                  As part of a team project that began in my second semester, we
                  developed a debt and loan management system called
                  <strong>My DebtZero</strong>. Before starting the project, we
                  visited GT-Max Motors in Seri Kembangan and interviewed staff
                  members to gain valuable insights into real-world loan
                  processes. This helped us better understand the needs of our
                  target users and ensured that the system we designed would
                  provide relevant and effective services. During the Software
                  Requirements Specification (SRS) phase, we outlined key
                  functionalities such as account registration, debt requests
                  and approvals, transaction management, debt detail viewing and
                  payment scheduling tailored to different user roles, including
                  debtors and loaners.

                  In the third semester, we moved forward with the software
                  architecture and design phase of the My DebtZero system. For
                  this phase, we adopted a Client-Server Architecture to
                  establish a clear separation between the user interface,
                  application logic, and data management components. This
                  architectural choice enabled us to design a well-structured
                  system where client devices handle the user interface, while
                  the server is responsible for managing complex operations such
                  as data processing, business logic, and database queries.
