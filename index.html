                  I am a dedicated and detail-oriented student with a deep
                  passion for software development. My academic journey has been
                  shaped by a strong sense of curiosity, perseverance, and a

                  I’ve had the opportunity to explore various aspects of
                  software development. I enjoy turning abstract ideas into
                  fully functioning, user-friendly web pages and mobile
                  applications. I thrive in environments that push me to
                  innovate, adapt, and think critically.

                  Beyond coding, I am deeply motivated by a sense of purpose and
                  a commitment to personal growth. My goal is to create
                  meaningful digital solutions that enhance people’s everyday
                  lives and solve real-world problems. I believe that with the
                  right mindset and skill set, technology can be a powerful tool
                  for positive change.
