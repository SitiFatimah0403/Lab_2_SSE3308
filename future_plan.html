                  Looking ahead, my goal over the next three years is to pursue
                  a career as a Data Analyst, with a long-term ambition to
                  specialise in Data Science. I am deeply fascinated by how data
                  can uncover insights, tell stories, and drive impactful
                  decisions — especially across industries such as business,
                  healthcare, and technology. I’m also passionate about emerging
                  technologies like
                  <strong
                    >Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cloud Computing,</strong
                  >
                  and I plan to deepen my expertise through courses,
                  certifications, and hands-on projects.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I aspire to gain industry experience by joining a
                  <strong
                    >Government-Linked Company (GLC) such as PETRONAS, Telekom
                    Malaysia (TM), or Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB),</strong
                  >
                  where I can work with real-world data at scale and contribute
                  to impactful national initiatives.
                </p>

                <p>
                  By combining data analytics with AI and cloud-based solutions,
                  I aim to drive innovation, improve system efficiency, and
                  create solutions that benefit society. Over the next few
                  years, I hope to collaborate on meaningful projects, grow my
                  technical capabilities, and evolve into a well-rounded tech
                  professional committed to contributing value through data and
                  technology.
